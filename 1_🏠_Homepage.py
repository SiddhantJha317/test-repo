            On my Substack I write about research in Machine Learning and Deep Learning :
            - I am currently in my Undergrad pursuing B.S in Data science at James Cook University , Australia.
            - I also make deployable Machine Learning projects available at my [Github Page ](https://github.com/SiddhantJha317).
            - I try to automate repetitive processes that I have to execute daily leveraging the power of Python.
            - I try to learn more and more Data science as time passes by me through various resources and try to educate people through my newsletter.
            - I am also passionate about the prospects of pure mathematical tools such Category Theory and Graphs, in improving neural network performance.
            If this sounds interesting to you, consider subscribing to my weekly Newsletter.
